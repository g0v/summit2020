## Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

In brief, please respect all participants.

### The Quick Version
Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including conference-related events or online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

### How to Report
If you witnessed or encountered any harassment, you can report the incident via one or both of the following channels:
- Seek assistance at the information desk at the entrance of "The Magic School of Green Technologies" building.
- File a report with this [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK8N0kXpLhMfmjiNz-uzuzpnAVX6QI4-ubu1NkX9bG7bNZ4g/viewform):

Rest assured that g0v Summit will not reveil the reporter's name and contact to anyone, except for the members of the "CoC task group" and the experts we deem necessary to consult with after due considerations.

Records of these incidents and our follow-up measures would be open to the public after de-identification of personal information of the reporter and the victim. By doing so, we hope to achieve the followings:

- Help future g0v Summit team understand the possible types of harassments and their appropriate counter-measures in order to improve on the process of reporting and handling.
- Help future participants understand with concrete examples the kinds of behavior that could make others feel uncomfortable.

### The Complete Version
Harassment includes:
- offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion,  sexual images in public spaces, profession, and political stance; 
- display sexual images in public spaces;
- deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; 
- sustained disruption of talks or other events;
- inappropriate physical contact;
- and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.（Exception: The act of showing sexualized pictures or videos for educational purposes in the speech is permitted.）。

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.

We value your attendance. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. 

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
