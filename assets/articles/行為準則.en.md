## Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers (“participants”) at our conference are required to agree and comply with the following Code of Conduct (CoC). Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.

In brief: please respect all participants.

### The Quick Version
Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of any participants in any way. Sexual imagery and language is not appropriate throughout the conference, including conference-related events and online media, except for educational programming content. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

### How to Report
If you witnessed or encountered any harassment, you can report the incident via the following channels:
- Seek assistance at the information desk at the entrance of “The Magic School of Green Technologies” building.
- Scan the QR code to file a report with the [Online Report Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK8N0kXpLhMfmjiNz-uzuzpnAVX6QI4-ubu1NkX9bG7bNZ4g/viewform).

Rest assured that g0v Summit will not reveal the reporter’s name and contact to anyone, except for the members of the “CoC Taskforce” and the experts with whom we deem necessary to consult after due considerations.

Records of these incidents and our follow-up measures would be open to the public after de-identification of personal information of all parties involved in the reporting process. By doing so, we hope to achieve the followings:

- Help future g0v Summit teams understand the possible types of harassments and their appropriate counter-measures in order to improve on the process of reporting and handling.
- Help future participants understand with concrete examples the kinds of behavior that could make others feel uncomfortable.

### The Complete Version
Harassment includes (but is not limited to):
- offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual appearance, profession, and political stance; 
- display of sexual imagery in public;
- deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; 
- sustained disruption of talks or other events;
- inappropriate physical contact;
- unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to stop immediately.

Sponsors of our conference are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexual images, behavior, or content in other format. Conference staff (including volunteers) should not adopt sexual clothing/uniform/costume or otherwise create a sexualized environment. Sexual imagery or language as part of programming for educational purposes is permitted.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a conference staff member immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they’ll be wearing branded clothing and/or badge.

We value your attendance. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel, venue security, or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. 

We expect participants to follow these rules at our conference and conference-related social events.
