Since then, the world has been inspired by Taiwan's approach to deliberative democracy. \n\nIn contrast to deliberative mechanisms evaluating one issue at a time, \"Political Machines\" focuses on political parties in democratic societies as \"compression algorithms\" for the public will, given an input of every issue simultaneously. That is, political parties are mechanisms for reconciling and reducing complexity in democratic systems — but the fight against polarization is a fight against oversimplification. \n\nCivic technologists can work with organizations like independent news to create public models of the public will that are higher dimensional and thus higher resolution. This is a call to embrace the complexity parties handle as a problem which can be approached with care and consideration rather than fear of chaos and disorder. \n\nChallenging ourselves as technologists to think about democracies beyond parties provides an enormous opportunity and freedom to consider what processes institutions might adopt with independently funded members of legislative bodies. This talk will consider both theory and case studies from around the world.",

The following introduces our previous projects.\n\nNullFull has been active since 2016, and we hold a weekly meeting on Mondays. The members participating in NullFull are developers, social activists, designers, data analysts, system engineers, and more.\n\nWe proudly introduce some of our projects as follows:\n* We draw a foodie map of the restaurants that congressmen “adore” to visit, based on the public data from the annual expenditure financial statement.\n* We assist consumers to easily detect whether a certain product is manufactured from one of the “infamous” food corporations - by taking a picture of the product barcode and uploading it on the website.\n* We demand legislative candidates to amend the existing criminal law to strongly penalize and punish sexual offenders - by creating an accessible system for the electors to directly send emails to parliamentary candidates.\n* Roast poor data visualizations from media and redo it by ourselves.\n",

    "summary": "民間/非官方公投是培養公民參與和集體表達意見的一種手段。在香港和澳門，中國試圖壓制民間投票。在過去的幾年中，公權力及有國家資助的行為者濫用了刑事訴訟程序及並發起了網絡攻擊，以干擾在香港和澳門的這些投票的運作。\n\n以2019年在澳門舉行的特首選舉民間投票為例，投票組織者在遭受多方面攻擊後，被迫提前結束投票。本議程將包括投票所面對的政治威脅以及在技術角度介紹防護措拖。我將討論當時來自中國拒絕服務（DoS）攻擊的模式、投票程式是否需要過度設計以及我為應對技術威脅所採取的措施。儘管在技術方面成功地守著了投票程式運行，但投票活動還是失敗了。投票組織者的主要成員收到對其人身安全受到威脅。組織者不僅提前中止了投票，還取消了計劃中的宣佈結果的新聞發佈會。從2019年澳門投票失敗中吸取的教訓可能會幫助有志者將來組織類似的投票。",
    "summary_en": "Civic / unofficial referendums have been a means of cultivating civic engagement and collective expression of opinions.  In the context of Hong Kong and Macau, China has attempted to clamp down on civic votes / referendums.  In the past few years, the authorities and state-sponsored actors have abused criminal procedures and launched cyberattacks to interfere with the organisation of these votes in both Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nIn the case of the 2019 Vote on Chief Execution Election in Macau, the vote organiser was forced to close the vote prematurely after encountering multifaceted attacks.   The presentation will cover the political threat facing the vote as well as the technical aspect of the defence.  I will discuss the pattern of the Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, whether over-engineering is necessary and the measures I took to mitigate these threats.  Despite the success in defence of the voting application on the technical front, the vote ended up a failure.  Key members of the vote organiser received threats to their personal safety.  Not only did the organiser halt the vote but also cancelled a planned press conference at which the results would be announced.  The lessons learnt from the failure of the 2019 Macau Vote might help others plan a similar vote in the future. ",
